    <h1>Deviate: The Science of Seeing Differently</h1>

    <h2>Beau Lotto, the world-renowned neuroscientist, entrepreneur, 
        and two-time TED speaker, takes us on a tour of how we perceive the world, 
        and how disrupting it leads us to create and innovate.</h2>

    <p>In his first major book, Lotto draws on over two decades of pioneering research 
        to explain that our brain didn't evolve to see the world accurately. 
        It can't! Visually stunning, with entertaining illustrations and optical illusions throughout, 
        and with clear and comprehensive explanations of the science behind how our perceptions operate, 
        Deviate will revolutionize the way you see yourself, others and the world.</p>
