    <h1>The hobbit</h1>

    <h2>The Hobbit is a series of three epic high fantasy adventure films directed by Peter Jackson.</h2>

    <p>The films are based on the 1937 novel The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien,
        with large portions of the trilogy inspired by the appendices to The Return of the King, 
        which expand on the story told in The Hobbit, as well as new material 
        and characters written especially for the films. 
        Together they act as a prequel to Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy.</p>
